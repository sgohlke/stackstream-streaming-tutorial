* Video input: Camera or webcam.

Software:
* Web browser: To host the stream and maybe show you viewers something in the browser. Google Chrome/Chromium related browsers are recommended.
* (optional): IDE for coding/live-coding.
* (optional): [stackstream-chatviewer](https://github.com/sgohlke/stackstream-chatviewer) app for windows if you want to keep an eye on the chat while presenting or coding.


### Preparations

#### General
* Topic: Think about what you want to do. You don't need a full concept, a basic idea what to do in the stream is a good starting point.
* Setup/equipment: See above, depending on your topic select the necessary equipment and make sure it is ready to use.
* Privacy: Check for secrecy/privacy issues from what you are saying and sharing.
  * When sharing your screen/desktop make sure you remove everything you do not want other people to see (background, apps, folders)
  * When sharing your browser make sure there is nothing in your browser you do not want other people to see. Tipp: Use separate browser profile for streaming.
  * When talking about yourself/someone, think about how much information you want to be public. 
* Interactions: Think about how you want to interact with the audience and tell them what you like to do.
  * Do you want to allow speakers to join? Are they able to join at the start, during the whole stream, or at the end of the stream?
  * Do you want to react to the chat at the start, during the whole stream, or at the end of the stream?
* Duration of the stream: Think about how long the stream will be or if you want to set yourself a limit for the stream length.
* (optional) Have something to drink(/eat) in range. Schedule breaks for long streams.
* (optional) For streams with multiple speakers ask non-speaking users to mute themselves if there are audio issues like echos/loopbacks.

#### You first private test stream

There is a tutorial on https://matched.io/how-to-livestream-on-stackstream/ that explains how to create a new room. Before your first "real" stream it is a good idea to create a **private room**, i.e. a room with visibility set to "private", to test your settings and get familiar with stackstream. The private room can be accessed only be someone who knows the url, e.g. https://stack-stream.com/case/my-test-room-113 . You can use this to test you room with a second (incognito) browser window or second device.
* Check that your browser can access the wanted audio, video and/or content share. You might need to grant the browser and/or operating system access to use audio/video/content.  
* Check your audio is working
* (optional) Check your video is working if you want to use it.
* Check you can share your content and it looks as intended. E.g. check if the font size in your IDE is big enough to be read, if not increase font size or enter presentation mode.

#### Create a new room

In order to host a live stream you need to create a room, see https://matched.io/how-to-livestream-on-stackstream/ . 
* Select a fitting topic. The topic will be used in the notifications. 
* Select the language for your stream. Users might get irritated if you set the wrong language.
* Select fitting technologies. The technologies will be used to notify users that set these as skills in their profile.
* If you do not want or need to start the stream immediately, create a Scheduled room. You can for example schedule the room in the next 15 minutes if you want prepare something.
* If you want your live stream to be available to everyone, do not set visibility to private.

#### (optional) Share the link to your room
You can share the link to your room on social media or the [stackstream discord server](https://discord.gg/22XphDqu7C) (for planned rooms use #planned_rooms, for live ones #live_rooms).

### Hosting your room
If the preparations are done and the time for the stream has come, you can start your room. While hosting the room there are a few things to do.
* (At the start of the stream) Check that users can see and hear you. If in the chat user mention there is an issue better try to fix it before continuing with the stream.
* Greet/welcome your users to the stream.
* Give a short intro on what you want to do.
* Keep interacting with the users (as you planned).
* (optional) If you get the feeling the stream is not going forward, think about waiting a short time and ending the stream.
* (optional) Ask the users to like the room and speaker(s).
* (At the end of the stream) say goodbye and thank everyone for watching and/or participating.

### (optional) Evaluation and Feedback
After your stream there will be a recording available. You can take a look at the recording and think about your experience with the stream.
* What was good and fun?
* What was bad?
* Was their feedback from users about my topic, room or me as speaker?
* Did I notice something to be improved in the next stream?
